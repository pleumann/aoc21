# Advent of Code 2021
This repo contains solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://www.adventofcode.com) in Java, all wrapped in a NetBeans project.

After building, the typical way to run a certain puzzle is (from the project directory):

```
java -cp dist/AdventOfCode21.jar day01.Puzzle1 src/day01/input.txt
```

Replace day (01-25) and puzzle (1 or 2) number as needed. Some days also contain additional classes with optimized solutions or one or more ```example.txt``` files that could be fed into the main class as a replacement for ```input.txt```. See source code for details.

Note that ```input.txt``` contains the input data I received. Yours may (and probably will) be different.
